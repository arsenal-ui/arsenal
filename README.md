Arsenal is an old collection of components, design patterns, generally anything I've found that can be reusable/modifiable/stuff-I-need-a-lot and other stuff I think could be useful. All written in Sass and attempts to comply with SMACSS and BEM with Pascal casing. Compiled with Node Sass.

The idea here is that every component can be divided into a Sass partial and easily added into an existing project once the base directory is installed.
