Arsenal
---
Arsenal is a collection of components, design patterns, generally anything I've found that can be reusable/modifiable/stuff-I-need-a-lot and other stuff I think could be useful.

The idea here is that every component can be divided into a SASS partial and easily added into an existing project once the base directory is installed.
